# Project 26 - Stripe Follow Along Nav

## Demo

https://andycodes.io/JavaScript30/26%20-%20Stripe%20Follow%20Along%20Nav/

## Objective

For this project, I built a nav bar with dropdown similar to how Stipe has it.

## JavaScript

The main take away from this project is `.getBoundingClientRect()`. It is a method returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
