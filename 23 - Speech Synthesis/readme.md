# Project 23 - Speech Synthesis

## Demo

https://andycodes.io/JavaScript30/23%20-%20Speech%20Synthesis/

## Objective

For this project, I built a speech synthesizer using the browser built in speech synthesis api.

The voices that are available varies from devices to devices.
To get the list of voice object I used the method `SpeechSynthesis.getVoices()`

To get the synthesizer to speak I used the method `SpeechSynthesis.speak()`
