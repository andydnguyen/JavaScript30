Hi there!

I really want to learn JS. I actually want to learn JS very well. While theoretical lectures are providing deep insights, I tend to forget them very quickly, unless I put them in practice right away. That's why I decided to compliment them with this practical series.

Thanks to combining there two approaches I will (hopefully) understand programming principles and learn to use them effectively.

Thanks!
