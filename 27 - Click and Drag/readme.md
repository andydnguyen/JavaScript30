# Project 27 - Click and Drag

## Demo

https://andycodes.io/JavaScript30/27%20-%20Click%20and%20Drag/

## Objective

For this project, I built a nav bar with dropdown similar to how Stipe has it.

## JavaScript

The main take away from this project is `.getBoundingClientRect()`. It is a method returns the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
