      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      team[3] = 'Andy';
      console.log('OUTPUT: team', team);

      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.age = 99;

      console.log('OUTPUT: cap3', cap3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
